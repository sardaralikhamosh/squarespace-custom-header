My decision to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning stems from my academic background, professional work, and personal mission. Growing up in Gilgit-Baltistan, I witnessed the gradual disappearance of Burushaski, my native language. This inspired me to explore AI-driven approaches for the digital preservation of endangered languages, combining my expertise in computing with my cultural heritage.

Academically, I hold a BSCS from AIOU (CGPA 3.19/4.0), complemented by research exposure in AI applications, computational biology, and digital systems. Professionally, I work as a Web Application Developer at SAP Communications and as an SEO specialist at Ikonic Solutions, where I have led multiple client projects, demonstrating leadership, responsibility, and adaptability. Alongside this, I volunteer with Shad Foundation, supporting youth development centers that empower disadvantaged communities.

My personal journey has not been without challenges. Coming from a remote and underprivileged area, I overcame financial and social barriers, while managing a physical impairment in my left leg. These experiences strengthened my resilience, adaptability, and commitment to contributing back to society.

Looking ahead, my career goal is to become a leading researcher in computing, self learning systems and language technology. I aim to establish frameworks for digitalizing endangered languages like Burushaski, while also contributing to Pakistan’s broader digital transformation. A UK Master’s will equip me with world-class knowledge, cutting-edge skills, and international collaborations to achieve this vision and create long-term societal impact.
